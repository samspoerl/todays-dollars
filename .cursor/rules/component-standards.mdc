# React Component Standards

- Props interface at the top
- Component as named export
- Organize the code within React components
    - Use this specific order:
        1. Hooks
        2. Utils
        3. Event handlers
        4. Render
    - Add inline comments to delineate the sections, like this:
        ```tsx
        // HOOKS (state, refs, custom hooks, effects)
        // UTILS (computed values, helpers)  
        // EVENT HANDLERS (user interactions)
        ```
