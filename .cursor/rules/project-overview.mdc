# Project Overview

An **inflation calculator** web app called **Today's Dollars**.

## Goal

This app aims to answer the question: "How much is that in today's dollars?" For example: "How much would $100 in 1975 be worth in today's dollars?"

## Data

Historical inflation data is obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) API:
- Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE)
